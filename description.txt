# Hello, Doctor!
This Mod for Terraria is made for Arknights Doctor. I'm creating the Mod based on the idea of Arknights, adding my own interpretation.<br>
Have a good life of Arknights in Terraria, Doctor!

## What is Arknights?
Arknights is a mobile tower defense (TD) game developed by Hypergryph. I think you Terraria lovers will love it!

## What can you do with the Mod?
You can play it as Arknights Doctor, and can use many items associated with many Operators.

## How to play?
First, please purchase [the Desktop version (Steam) of Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/), and download [tModLoader](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/) (which is free). tModLoader will automatically launch Terraria and allow you to install mods.
Once it is up and running, select Workshop from the menu and open the Mod Browser. Then, search for Arknights Mod. Or download it directly from the Terraria forum (link) and place the file in `%userprofile%/Documents/My Games/Terraria/ModLoader/Mods/` for Windows or in`~/Library/Application support/Terraria/tModLoader/Mods` for Mac.
